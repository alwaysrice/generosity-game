“A cage?”
“Wait, where’s—”

“I don’t remember how I got here, but you have to help me out of this place.”
“I would use my magic, but…”

“Oh, hurry and grab the key hanging there!”

“There’s a good kitty.”

“Thank goodness you were here, I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“My magic… I can barely feel it.”
“It’s not completely gone, it’s just… missing.”
“…Anyways, let’s get out of here.”

Nyota: “…Where is everyone?”

“This gap… I don’t think I have enough magic to fly across.”
“Maybe we should turn back.”

“Paka, come back! Darn that cat..”

Nyota: “What has gotten into you?”

32
“Oh, the lantern!”
“Usually they’re lit with magic, aren’t they?”
“Hm… let me try.”

33
Nyota: “Looks like that did something. Come on!”
