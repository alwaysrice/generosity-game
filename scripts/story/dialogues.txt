“Huh? What happened…? Where am I?”
“A cage?”
“Wait, where’s—”

12
“Paka!”

13
“I’m glad you’re okay! I was about to start worrying.”
“I don’t remember how I got here, but you have to help me out of this place.”
“I would use my magic, but…”

14
“Oh, hurry and grab the key hanging there!”

15
“There’s a good kitty.”

16
“Thank goodness you were here, I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“My magic… I can barely feel it.”
“It’s not completely gone, it’s just… missing.”
“…Anyways, let’s get out of here.”

0
“Let’s get out of here first.”

21
“This is… the Moon Palace.”
“Has it always been this empty?”

22
Nyota: “Hello? Can anyone hear me?”

23
“Why’s there a hole in the floor?”
“Well, I should be able to jump over this.”

24
Nyota: “…Where is everyone?”

25
“Another gap… This is too big for me to jump over.”
“I should have enough magic to fly over it.”

26
“This gap… I don’t think I have enough magic to fly across.”
“Maybe we should turn back.”

27
“Paka, come back! Darn that cat..”

31
“What has gotten into you?”

32
“Oh, the lantern!”
“Usually they’re lit with magic, aren’t they?”
“Hm… let me try.”

33
“Looks like that did something. Come on!”

41
“Woah.”

42
“I know this is the Moon Palace, but wow.”
“Wait, what’s that?”

43
“It’s… a star. Oh, and it’s broken, the poor thing…”
“I can sense the missing pieces nearby. We should find them and quickly!”

44
“Hmm, they’re hidden behind these barriers. Who would do such a thing?”
“Stand back, Paka. I’m going to try and decode it.”

45
“Thank you, oh wandering traveler.”

46
“…And her feline companion.”
“I would have been lost if it weren’t for your help and I am eternally grateful.”
“Please, tell me how I may help you.”

47
“I can sense that your magic is very weak.”
“You will need your strength if you wish to go further into the palace.”
“Here, allow me to share some of my stardust with you.”

48
“My magic. It feels a bit stronger now.”
“Thank you, dear star!”
“I wish you a safe journey across the cosmos.”

49
“Did you see that? We got to meet a real star!”
“Anyways, I should have enough magic now to cross the large gap. Let’s go back there.”

51
“Here! I should have enough magic to fly across now.”

"Paka can't come right now..."
